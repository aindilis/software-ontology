	 Syntactic  controls: The $title  system is  a (system  for)? "..."
	 Tag line, under 70 characters, do not puncuate end.
	 
	 Semantic controls:  Purpose of  short-description is to  provide a
	 one  line  summary that  gives  some  indication  of the  system's
	 capabilities  for  things  like  apt.   It is  equivalent  to  the
	 short-desc from the Debian control file.

	 QUOTED FROM DEBIAN POLICY

	 3.4.1 The single line synopsis

	 The single line synopsis should be kept brief - certainly under 80
	 characters.

	 Do not include the package  name in the synopsis line. The display
	 software knows how to display this already, and you do not need to
	 state it. Remember  that in many situations the  user may only see
	 the synopsis line - make it  as informative as you can.

	 (Answers question .)

	 QUOTED FROM DEBIAN POLICY

	 3.4.2 The extended description

	 Do not try to continue  the single line synopsis into the extended
	 description.  This   will  not   work  correctly  when   the  full
	 description  is  displayed, and  makes  no  sense  where only  the
	 summary (the single line synopsis) is available.

	 The extended description should describe what the package does and
	 how  it relates  to  the rest  of  the system  (in  terms of,  for
	 example, which subsystem it is which part of).

	 The description field  needs to make sense to  anyone, even people
	 who  have  no idea  about  any of  the  things  the package  deals
	 with.[6]

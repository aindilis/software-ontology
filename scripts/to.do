(You can parse well formed HTML using SWI-Prolog library(sgml),
 in particular load_html/2.  My experience, scraping 'real world'
 websites, isn't really pleasant, because of insufficient error
 handling.  Anyway, when you will have loaded the page structure,
 you will have available library(xpath) to inspect such complex
 data.)
